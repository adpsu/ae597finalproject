Subject: Fall 2024 Internship Hours

Hi Mari,

I hope you are doing well.

I am writing to discuss the possibility of adjusting my internship hours for Fall 2024. I have previously worked as a GA at my university's HPC center, and one of my mentors has reached out to ask if I could work with them for 20 hours a week in the fall, as other experienced GAs are graduating this summer.

Given this opportunity, I wanted to explore whether it would be possible to reduce my internship hours to 20 hours per week. Could you please help me understand any potential consequences of this adjustment? I have had an initial discussion with Bo, and we want to ensure we understand the rules and regulations before moving forward.

Thank you for your assistance.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
