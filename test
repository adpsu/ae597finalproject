### Email to CARB

**Subject: Inquiry on Historic BEV and PHEV Incentives in California (2010-Present)**

Dear California Air Resources Board,

I hope this message finds you well. My name is [Your Name], and I am currently working on a study that evaluates the impact of state-level incentives on the adoption of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) in California.

As part of my research, I am seeking detailed information on the historic incentives provided by the state for BEVs and PHEVs from 2010 to the present. This includes, but is not limited to, rebate amounts, eligibility requirements, and any changes to the incentive programs over the years.

I would greatly appreciate it if you could provide or direct me to the relevant data or reports that outline these incentives. Understanding the evolution of these incentives is crucial for the accuracy and comprehensiveness of my study.

Thank you for your time and assistance. I look forward to your response.

Best regards,
